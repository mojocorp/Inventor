The problems described below occur on Linux platforms we tested. Note that some
of these may be due to older versions of other libraries, i.e. LessTif or Mesa.

1. Font capabilities used by SoAsciiText and SoText[23] are currently provided
   by libFL.a. On IRIX, libFL.so is provided in the eoe.sw.gfx and eoe.sw64.gfx
   subsystems. A version of libFL.a compiled for SunOS 5.8 is available in the
   FTP download area. No other platforms are currently supported. Look in
   README.FIRST for more information on using Ang Bodhi's FreeType interface.

2. Arrowhead cones in transformer dragger appear squished. This occurs on IRIX
   and Linux.

3. When selecting hidden-line view in viewers, the following error is printed
   for models with colors specified in arrays:

     Inventor error in SoIndexedShape(): material index n is out of range 0 - 1

   This occurs on IRIX and Linux.

4. SceneViewer crashes when loading temple.iv (binary format). This occurs
   with Lesstif 0.91.4, but not 0.90.0 (see Bug 2).
