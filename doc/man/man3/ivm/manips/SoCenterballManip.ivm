NAME SoCenterballManip SoCballManip "" { transform node with 3D interface for editing rotation and center }

INCLUDE manips/SoCenterballManip.h

DESC { 
\cSoCenterballManip\. 
is derived from \cSoTransform\. (by way of \cSoTransformManip\.). 
When its fields 
change, nodes following it in the scene graph rotate, scale, and/or translate.
\p
As a subclass of \cSoTransformManip\., this manipulator
also has a 3D interface to edit some of its fields.
In this case, the interface edits the \vrotation\. and \vcenter\. fields.
\p
A manipulator differs from a dragger. When you move a dragger,
no other nodes are affected.  When you move an \cSoTransformManip\.,
other nodes move along with it.
(See the reference page for \cSoTransformManip\..)
\p
The interface for an \cSoCenterballManip\. is exactly the same as that
of the \cSoCenterballDragger\..  
To find out more about the interface, see the reference page 
for \cSoCenterballDragger\..  To find out how the manipulator uses a 
dragger to provide its interface, see the reference page for \cSoTransformManip\..
\p
On screen, this manipulator will surround the objects influenced by its motion.
This is because it turns on the \esurroundScale\. part of the dragger.
(See the reference page for \cSoSurroundScale\..)
