    \section DESCRIPTION
    drop  is  a  fun  game that tests your ability to drop 3d puzzle pieces
    onto a grid.  The goal of the game is to drop the  puzzle  pieces  onto
    the  green  court  and  form a solid grid of cubes.  Each time that you
    fill an entire grid, that grid unit will glow brightly  and  drop  down
    and  off  the  court.  You get extra points for each complete grid unit
    that you fill.  If you get enough points during a game, then  you  move
    to  the	next  (more  difficult) level. The game will get progressively
    harder as you ascend the levels (1-5).
    
    Type drop , and then immediately press the 'h' key for detailed playing
    instructions.
    
    This game was written using the Inventor 3d Toolkit.
