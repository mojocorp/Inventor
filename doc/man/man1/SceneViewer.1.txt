    \brief 3d editor and viewer for Inventor scenes
    
    \section SYNOPSIS
    SceneViewer [-e env_file] [file]
    
    \section DESCRIPTION
    SceneViewer  is	a  program  for  viewing and interacting with Inventor
    scene graph files (the SGI 3D file format standard).   SceneViewer  was
    written	to  demonstrate Inventor features, and serves as the basis for
    the IRIS Explorer Render Module.
    
    When SceneViewer is run, a window appears containing the Inventor exam-
    iner viewer and a menu bar. The viewer allows the user to interactively
    change the view of the scene through direct manipulation,  or  indirect
    slider  and  push button controls.  The menu bar contains the following
    menus:
    
    File
          This menu supports file reading and writing, and launches a dia-
          log for printing to a printer or to PostScript file.
    
    Edit
          This  menu  enables  copy  and  paste  of 3D data, selecting all
          objects, and deleting the currently selected objects.
    
    Viewing
          This menu controls viewing options.  It allows different viewing
          paradigms  to  be employed: the examiner viewer which provides a
          virtual trackball interface, the fly-through viewer for  travel-
          ing  through  expansive data sets, the walk viewer for architec-
          tural walk-throughs, and the plane viewer for orthographic  pro-
          jections.   The  menu  also  enables  different  types of trans-
          parency, fog effects, antialiasing, and  background  color  con-
          trols.
    
    Selection
          This  menu  allows the different selection policies to be demon-
          strated.	A selection policy determines how  objects  get  added
          and removed from the collection of selected objects.
    
    Editors
          This  menu  launches  the material editor and transform sliders.
          An object must be selected for the menu to be active.
    
    Manips
          This menu allows different manipulators to act  on  the  current
          selection,  including  the  trackball,  handle box, jack, center
          ball, and transform box.	Manipulators can also be  turned  off,
          in  which  case selected objects are surrounded with a red wire-
          frame box highlight.
    
    Lights
          This menu allows directional, point, and spot lights to be  cre-
          ated  and edited. It also allows lights to be turned on and off.
    
    For more information on how to use the viewers and editors employed  by
    the scene viewer, please see SceneViewer's runtime help cards.
