    \brief a nostalgic 3d game
    
    \section SYNOPSIS
    maze [maze file]
    
    \section DESCRIPTION
    maze  is a fun 3d game that will test your ability to navigate a marble
    through a 3d maze by tilting the floor of the maze.  The object of  the
    game  is to maneuver the marble through the entire maze without falling
    into any of the holes.  There is only one path through the maze and  it
    is NOT marked.
    
    Use  the  left  mouse  to  control the tilt of the maze floor.  You can
    adjust the view of maze by pressing the right mouse button and choosing
    the  Decoration	on menu button.  This will add some additional buttons
    around the window which can be used to adjust the  view	of  the  maze.
    Click  the top right toggle button to switch into viewing mode and then
    adjust your view by pressing the  left  and/or  middle  mouse  buttons.
    Click the "?" button to get help on how to use the viewer. When you are
    done adjusting your view, hit the toggle button again and resume  play.
    Be careful to not disorient your play by overadjusting the view.
    
    The  game  offers 3 levels of difficulty; press the "1" key to play the
    starter maze, the "2" key for the difficult maze, and the "3"  key  for
    the  masochist  maze. Pressing these keys at ANY TIME will restart the
    game at that level. Pressing the "r" key will restart the game at  the
    current level.
    
    If  the marble falls in a hole, press the "r", "1", "2", or "3" key to
    restart the game.
    
    maze was written using the Inventor 3d Toolkit.
    
    \section BUILDING YOUR OWN MAZE
    You can build your own mazes by creating maze files and then running
    maze with the maze file as an argument. The top array specifies the
    location of horizontal walls, the middle array specifies the location
    of vertical walls, and the bottom array specifies locations of holes.
    In the first two arrays, a 1 means a wall is present, and a 0 means no
    wall is present. In the third array, a 1 means a hole is present. A
    value of 2 in the hole array signifies the starting point, and a value
    of 3 signifies the ending (winning) point in the maze.
    
    Here's the starter (level 1) maze file:
