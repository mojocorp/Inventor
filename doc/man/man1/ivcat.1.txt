/*! \file ivcat
    \brief concatenates and converts Inventor files
    
    \section SYNOPSIS
    ivcat [-bfht] [-o file] [file ...]
    
    \section DESCRIPTION
    ivcat  reads  each  file  in  sequence and then writes each out.  If no
    input file is given, or a filename of "-"  is  specified,  ivcat  reads
    from  the  standard  input  file.   The	input files must be valid Open
    Inventor 3D Interchange Format files (1.0 or 2.0).
    
    The following command line options are allowed:
    
    -b   Write out the files in binary Inventor format.  The default is  to
        write out the files in Inventor's ASCII format.
    
    -f   Remove  all SoFile nodes.  This has the effect of condensing hier-
        archical files into a single file.
    
    -h   Print usage message.
    
    -o file
        Send the output to the given file, instead of to the standard out-
        put.
    
    -t   Expand  SoTexture2	nodes  to  explictly  include the texture data
        rather than a file name.
    
    \section EXAMPLES
    To convert from binary to ASCII Inventor
    
          ivcat < binaryfile.iv > asciifile.iv
    
    To convert from ASCII to binary Inventor:
    
          ivcat -b < asciifile.iv > binaryfile.iv
