    \brief restructures an Inventor object for improved rendering performance
    
    \section SYNOPSIS
    ivfix [ -ahntvV ] [ -d dir ] [infile] [outfile]
    
    \section DESCRIPTION
    ivfix reads an Inventor object  and  restructures  it  to  improve  the
    object's rendering performance.	ivfix processes the scene graph in two
    phases:
    
    Phase 1)
          Analyzes the organization of the input scene graph, and tries to
          sort  it	a better way to take advantage of coherence. For exam-
          ple, it tries to organize subgraphs by  common  textures,  since
          switching  textures is expensive.  Once sorted, it also tries to
          combine subgraphs so that the final result has fewer nodes.
    
    Phase 2)
          "Flattens" the subgraphs that result from the first phase.  This
          tessellates  all	shapes	into triangles that are then organized
          into triangle strips.  For example, two spheres may be  combined
          into one triangle strip.
    
    Warning!  ivfix does not try to preserve any non-appearance attributes,
    such as names.  It will also remove most engines, animation nodes,  and
    field-to-field  connections.   ivfix is best run on individual objects,
    not on entire scenes.  When rendered, the output object will be equiva-
    lent  to  the  original	file, but much of the object hierarchy will be
    lost.
    
    Note also that the output file may be larger than the input file.   For
    example, a sphere node will be converted into triangle strips.
    
    The following command line options are allowed:
    
    -a   Write an ASCII file.  The output file is binary by default.
    
    -d dir
        Add dir to the list of directories to search, e.g. for file nodes.
    
    -h   Print the usage message.
    
    -n   Do not generate any normals.
    
    -p   ivfix usually  tries  to  define  properties  as  SoVertexProperty
        nodes.  This option prevents that.
    
    -t   Do not generate any texture coordinates.
    
    -v   (Verbose) Display status information during processing.
    
    -V   (Very verbose) Display more detailed status information.
