/*! \file iv2toiv1
    \brief converts Inventor 2.0 files to the Inventor 1.0 format
    
    \section Synopsis
    iv2toiv1 infile outfile
    
    \section DESCRIPTION
    iv2toiv1  reads	the input file infile and writes it to the output file
    outfile in Inventor 1.0 format.
    
    \section Notes
    Because of differences between the 1.0 and 2.0 file formats, some  data
    may  be	lost  during the conversion to 1.0. For instance, the 2.0 file
    format for SoSeparator contains fields for caching and culling, but the
    1.0 format for SoSeparator has no fields. This information is lost dur-
    ing the conversion process.
