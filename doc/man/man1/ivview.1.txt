    \brief fast, interactive 3D viewer of Inventor files
    
    \section Synopsis
    ivview [-hpw] [files | < file]
    
    \section DESCRIPTION
    ivview  reads  an Inventor file (or files) and provides a simple inter-
    face to quickly view 3D data. The input files must be valid Inventor 3D
    files  (versions  1.0  or 2.0).	All the files specified at the command
    line are read in and rendered.
    
    ivview presents a single window containing an Inventor viewer (examiner
    viewer or the walk viewer) and a menu bar.
    
    Note that if you click and hold the right mouse button, the viewer pop-
    up capabilities will be displayed.  Also, note that the	viewer	has  a
    help card that provides detailed instruction on how to use it.
    
    The menu bar contains the following menus:
    
    File
          This  menu  presents a file Open button, (reads an Inventor file
          and replaces existing object), an About button, (displays infor-
          mation about the program), and a Quit button.
    
    Options
          This  menu  includes  a  High quality transparency toggle button
          that turns the high-quality transparency option on and off (high
          quality	uses  DELAYED_BLEND  transparency,  low  quality  uses
          SCREEN_DOOR transparency), and an Edit background  color	button
          that  pops up the Inventor Color Editor to change the background
          color.
    
    Optimize
          This menu includes an Optimize for speed toggle button that will
          run  the	ivfix  utility and a Cull backfaces toggle button that
          will insert an SoShapeHints node that will cause only front-fac-
          ing  polygons  to be drawn.  When checked, both of these options
          apply to the current scene and any  scenes  read	in  using  the
          File/Open menu.  Note that the ivfix utility completely restruc-
          tures the scene, losing any interaction or  animation  nodes  or
          engines.
    
    \section OPTIONS
    The following command line options are allowed:
    
    -h     Prints the usage message for ivview.
    
    -p     Enables the performance meter.  Off by default.
    
    -w     Use an SoXtWalkViewer instead of the default SoXtExaminerViewer.
          Off by default.  This option is incompatible with the -p option.
