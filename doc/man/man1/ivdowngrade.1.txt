/*! \file ivdowngrade
    \brief converts Inventor 2.1 files to the Inventor 2.0 and 1.0 formats
    
    \section SYNOPSIS
    ivdowngrade [-v targetVersion] [infile outfile | infile ]
    
    \section DESCRIPTION
    ivdowngrade reads the input file infile and converts it to the Inventor
    format  specified  by  -v  targetVersion , either 1.0 or 2.0. If the -v
    option is not specified, an Inventor V2.0 file will be  generated.  The
    input file can be in Inventor or VRML format. The output will always be
    in ascii format.  If no output file is specified, ivdowngrade writes to
    stdout. If  no input file is specified as well, ivdowngrade reads from
    stdin.
    
    \section EXAMPLE
    ivdowngrade -v 1.0 foo.iv moo.iv
         Downgrades the file foo.iv to Inventor V1.0  format,  writing  to
         moo.iv.
    
    ivdowngrade goo.iv
         Downgrades  the  file  goo.iv to Inventor V2.0 format, writing to
         stdout.
    
    \section NOTES
    Because of differences between the 1.0 and 2.0 file formats, some  data
    may  be	lost  during the conversion to 1.0. For instance, the 2.0 file
    format for SoSeparator contains fields for caching and culling, but the
    1.0 format for SoSeparator has no fields. This information is lost dur-
    ing the conversion process.
    No data is lost going from the 2.1 to the 2.0 format.
