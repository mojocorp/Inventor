    \brief 3d morphing program
    
    \section SYNOPSIS
    qmorf [qfile1] [qfile2] ...
    
    \section DESCRIPTION
    qmorf  reads  in a series of Inventor quad mesh files and draws an ani-
    mated sequence which metamorphoses from one object to the next.	 These
    quad  mesh  files  must	meet  the exact specifications described below
    (40x40).
    
    Qmorf is not related to other morphing programs (like the program  used
    to  produce  the  effects in Michael Jackson's "Black or White" video).
    Those programs use image warping techniques to modify 2D  images;  this
    program actually modifies an object's 3D geometry.
    
    qmorf was written using the Open Inventor 3d Toolkit.  Currently, qmorf
    is only able to interpolate between files that contain QuadMeshes  with
    40  by 40 vertices (1521 quads).  Standard C++ code is used to linearly
    interpolate the positions of the vertices of the intermediate geometry.
    Open  Inventor is used to linearly interpolate the objects' textures or
    materials.  The intermediate geometry is drawn twice,  first  with  the
    first  set  of  materials  or  textures or materials applied.  Then the
    object is drawn again with the second  set  of  materials  or  textures
    applied, modified to be semi-transparent.  Open Inventor (using OpenGL)
    blends the semi-transparent object with the already drawn geometry.  By
    varying the level of transparency, a smooth fade from one object's tex-
    ture to the next is achieved.  The  background  is  derived  from  code
    originally  written  by	Drew  Olbrich.	It is a 21 by 21 QuadMesh (400
    quads) with a different material at each vertex.  The positions of  the
    vertices  are  determined  by a variety of mathematical functions (e.g.
    sine waves, exponential functions, etc), while the  colors  are	deter-
    mined by a fractal noise function.  The positions and colors are edited
    each frame of the animation , interpolating from one set  of  positions
    and  colors  to the next.  The total number of quads in any given frame
    is 3,442 (1552*2+400).  The main window of the program is the  standard
    Inventor  Examiner  Viewer  Xt  component.   The button and sliders are
    Motif widgets.
    
    Textures are automatically turned off if too slow!
